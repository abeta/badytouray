<div>Following a brief spell away from the ring working in his other love of rap music; Bady is now fully focused on the sweet science of boxing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>He is seeking to fight as many times as possible before looking to turn professional in late 2015/early 2016 - and has established an impressive run of 10 fights in a 3 month period recently.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bady fights at middleweight and is delighted to be training in the home town of a world champion in Chris Eubank.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>He is trained by Harlem Eubank and trains alongside Freedom Eubank so he really is working with the best as he continues his progress.&nbsp;</div>
