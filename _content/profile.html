<p>From eloquently rapping words as an MC to wrapping his fists as a fighter, Bady is a born performer, moving effortlessly between these two world's. He began training  at the age of 8 years old in Brighton & Hove's established ABC Boxing gym.</p>
<p>Beginning his training with former British Heavyweight champion Scott Welch, he quickly went on to become the South East school boy champion 2 years in a row, after which he switched his focus to begin a successful music career as a rapper, performing up and down the U.K, supporting some of the biggest urban acts such as Wretch 32 & Lethal B amongst others.</p>
<p>After years of writing tracks, selling mixtapes & performing on stage, Bady has now returned to the sweet science, having established an  impressive run of 10 bouts in only 3 months time. Training alongside the talented Harlem Eubanks<br />Bady now looks forward to turning professional as a middleweight contender in 2015</p>
