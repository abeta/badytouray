<p>Martin Durrant was&nbsp;Bady's&nbsp;mandatory challenger and final step as they go head to head to fight for the UKBU English Light-Cruiserweight Title belt. This fight was a great 4 rounder at the famous York Hall in Bethnal Green against a strong opponent. It was a great war between both boxers and the best man won on the night and sadly Bady lost the war by split decision to a home town ticket seller.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
