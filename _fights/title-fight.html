<p>Bady vs Danny 2 go head to head in an all out war and this time it was for the Light heaveyweight Title held at The Clapham Grand in London. The last time Bady met Danny was at the famous York Hall venue in Bethnal Green which Bady ended the show early by stopping Danny in the 2nd round. Danny was after a rematch with Bady to get his revenge after the York Hall Upset, the fight went the distance making Bady puling out his defnsive skills to aviod big shots from Danny which lead Danny winnin the Title fight by 1 point. Bady 1/Danny 1 = Best out of 3</p>
