<p>I arrived in Essex at 10am with my cutman Colin for the morning weigh-in, which was held at the Fight Academy, Friday 5th December with my cut man.  Whilst there I bumped into Former IBA Champion Terry ‘The Tan’ Wright who was there as a trainer for one of his fighters.   </p>
<p>It took me a while to get my punches off and establish a rhythm, so the first round went to my opponent Ricky Rocker due to his greater output and determination.</p>
<p>During the 2nd round I started moving a lot more, throwing off combinations and establishing the ja which I was having success with whilst my opponent gave as good as he got.</p>
<p>The 3rd was an all action round with Ricky using his footwork and power effectively, I was hitting him with fast and accurate shots, using my speed advantage and good footwork from the opening bell to frustrate my opponent, who was determined throughout the fight.</p>
<p>I felt the tide was turning in my favour heading into the 4th round, despite it being a very evenly fought,  towards the end of the round I threw a shot and  it injured my elbow, I tried shaking it off and fighting back for two rounds but the pain was making me unable to throw out the jab or mount a significant attack. I kept throwing my hands up in paIn, so my corner decided to pull me out of the fight.</p>
<p><strong><br />I would love to have carried on fighting with Ricky as I think it was the best fight I've had so far this year..</strong></p>
